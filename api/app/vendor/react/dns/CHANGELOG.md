## 0.4.11 (2017-08-25)

*   Feature: Support resolving from default hosts file
    (#75, #76 and #77 by @clue)

    ```php
    $resolver->resolve('localhost')->then(function ($ip) {
        echo 'IP: ' . $ip;

    The new `HostsExecutor` exists for advanced usage and is otherwise used
    internally for this feature.
